title: Partner With Us

## Join Us

We don't want to go on this journey on our ownâ€”we can't! We need others to partner with us to help in different ways. We would love for you to join us!

If you can't donate right now, partnering with us is a great way to find other ways to help out. If you can donate right now, partnering is a way to multiply your impact.

Partnering is easy to do. To get started, all you need to do is follow us on social media or sign up for our email list. This will allow us to both keep you updated on our journey and send you ideas for ways you can help.

## Ways You Can Help

- Provide encouragement or advice.
- Pray for specific needs.
- Share our adoption story with others.
- Donate your skills or connections to help us in our adoption process. You never know when a skill you have could come in handy!
- Organize a fundraiser. Could you sell food or crafts, do a concert, or provide services you offer to help raise money for our adoption?

## Stories

Some of the people who have already partnered with us include:

- Mandi Mitchell and Denise Crull provided photography.
