## Our Family

For those who may not know us, we are Josh and Jennifer Justice. We have been married for 8 years and have two daughters, Emily (3.5) and Katherine (1.5), and one dog, Ammy (11).

We hope to add to our family soon by adopting an African-American baby boy. The girls are excited about having a baby brother!

## Where We Are

Adoption is a journey and we are just beginning. We are certain of God's call on our hearts, and we know He will use [people like you](partner-with-us) to get us there, providing donations, support, words of encouragement, and prayers.

Financial responsibility is important to us, which is why we are saving and fundraising before moving forward.

## Join the Journey

We want to be transparent with you about each step of the process. This website gives you the basics of the journey. If you would like to receive updates with more details, you can partner with us by connecting on social media or our email list.
