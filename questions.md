## Why adoption?

Our heart for adoption is born out of gratitude to God for loving us and pursuing us when we were powerless to offer Him anything. Since our dating days, we have shared an openness to the possibility of adopting in our family. God has blessed us with two biological children, and as far as we know, we could have more. But over the past year, God unexpectedly started us on a journey to adopt when we next add to our family.

## Why domestic newborn adoption?

The adoption needs in the world are overwhelming. There are countless orphans in other countries, hundreds of thousands of children in the US foster care system, and thousands of babies voluntarily being placed for adoption.

We are inspired by the stories of both friends and strangers who have welcomed these children into their families. Every story is unique. Our story begins with a powerful challenge from our pastor, Andy Stanley, to “do for one what you wish you could do for everyone.”

This challenge applies to every child needing a home, but we feel God has specifically challenged us to consider what we can do for expectant mothers, as well. We recognize the weighty challenges these women may face, and the hard decisions they need to make. We wish every woman could be assured of a loving community to walk beside her when facing an unintended pregnancy — a community to support her through her pregnancy and a specific family to welcome her baby into their home if that is the path she chooses.

# We can't be that family for every woman, but God has made it possible for us to be that family for one.

## How does the adoption process support the expectant mother?

We know not every woman has access to a loving community to walk beside her through pregnancy, but we do know there are organizations and ministries filled with people who provide that community for many women every day. For our adoption, we hope to use an adoption consultant, [Faithful Adoption Consultants](https://www.faithfuladoptionconsultants.com/), out of Atlanta, GA. FAC works with agencies and attorneys across the United States, and their passion is for both birth families and adoptive families to be loved and cared for throughout the adoption process.

Every situation is different so our family may or may not directly interact with the expectant mom through her pregnancy, but there will be people surrounding her to support her in many ways. Our adoption costs allow this community to provide medical, financial, and emotional support throughout the expectant mother’s pregnancy, as well as pre- and post-birth counseling. Depending on the situation, adoption funds may also provide housing, transportation, food, clothing, or assistance with other children.

## Why African-American?

When we started seriously considering adoption, we knew that we were open to any gender or race and that we wanted to provide a home and family for a child who might otherwise be overlooked. As we talked with friends and professionals about newborn adoption needs in our country, it became clear God was calling us to a more specific child — an African-American boy.

The heartbreaking reality is there is a vast shortage of families seeking to adopt African-American children. We know transracial adoption comes with its own set of unique challenges, yet this is the path God has led us to and we are trusting He will equip us with what we need to face those challenges. We are grateful He has already brought friends into our lives several years ahead of us on this path to whom we can turn for support, advice, insight, and education.

## Why fundraising first?

<a name="why-fundraising-first"></a>

Our budget with Faithful Adoption Consultants is roughly $42,000. We have$10,000 saved, and there is currently an adoption tax credit around $12,000. That leaves$20,000 yet to be covered. We know God can provide this in many different ways. We would love for you to be part of that way, and that's why we are fundraising first.

We are both blessed to have parents who taught us principles of handling our finances responsibly. We give a percentage, save a percentage, and live within our means. Of course, like everyone else, we are tempted to splurge. In light of the high costs of adoption, we have been tightening the reigns on our spending: eating out less, giving careful thought to purchases, deferring what we can in order to put more towards our adoption savings. We are grateful God has put us in a position where we have significant funds to put toward our adoption costs. We want you to know we wouldn't ask you to contribute without doing our part.
