## Financial Goal

Our total goal is $42,000. $22,000 of this is accounted for by [our savings](questions#why-fundraising-first) and the tax adoption credit. We are trusting God to provide the rest in his timing.

## Possible Expenses

Our financial goal is based on our estimated total budget with [FAC](questions#fac). A hypothetical breakdown of expenses is as follows, but every situation is unique.

| Consultant Fee | $4,000 |
| Home Study Fee | $2,000 |
| Agency Legal Fees | $19,000 |
| Birth Mother Expenses | $16,000 |
| Out-of-Pocket incl. Travel | $1,000 |
| Total | $42,000 |

## Donate

If you have personal outstanding debt, we would love for you to [partner with us](partner-with-us) in ways other than donating money. On the other hand, if you only have \$10 to spare and would like to contribute, please know that no gift is too small!

You have two options for donating:

[Directly](direct-donation) -
100% goes to us, not tax deductible

[Through a Non-Profit](https://adopttogether.org/families/?fundraiser=justiceadoption) -
Tax deductible, 5% fees
