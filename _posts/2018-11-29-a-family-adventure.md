title: A Family Adventure
---

Our family is uniquely positioned to be able to live anywhere during this season of life. The girls aren't in school and Josh telecommutes most days anyway, so given that we really want to be local and available when baby boy decides to make his arrival, we decided it made sense to go ahead and "move" to Louisiana for the month of December! We found a great deal on a lovely AirBnB house and drive out this morning!

I knew logistically it would be more difficult bringing the girls with us, but as I thought about this whole experience and given our situation, I loved the idea of our family going on this adventure together rather than the girls feeling left out during this momentous event. They are so excited to drive to Louisiana to meet baby brother!

God has given me remarkable peace as we continue to take steps forward on a path that is inherently filled with unknowns and risks. He has so clearly led us this far, He knows what is ahead, and I know we can trust Him wholeheartedly with whatever may be.

Something that not everyone may know is that every newborn adoption is at "risk" of not happening. Birth mothers are given time after baby is born before they are even allowed to sign over parental rights (our situation requires 5 days). In a perfect world, every baby would stay with his/her birth mother, and it seems right to me to err on the side of making sure that the mother is given space and time before finalizing this decision.

This doesn't mean that we won't meet baby until his mother signs papers. It's up to her to decide how long she wants to stay with baby. From what I understand, it is typical for birth mothers to either immediately hand baby to the adoptive parents or wait a few hours or even after a night together. We have not had much communication with the expectant mother so I am not sure what she will choose to do. Just another one of the many unknowns in this process!

We would so appreciate your prayers for all of the many parts of this adventure. Please pray for:

- Safe and happy travels
- Our family to sleep well and feel at home in an unfamiliar house
- Our adoption attorney as she works toward completing all of the many steps necessary before the adoption can be finalized
- The expectant family to feel loved and supported by us and that God would comfort and encourage their hearts during this difficult time of loss
- A safe delivery and health for both mom and baby
- Our hearts to be prepared for life as a family of 5 (and all that comes with newborn life and adding a sibling to the mix ðŸ˜‰)!

Thank you and love to you all! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’•
