title: Applications Sent!
---

This was a big week moving forward with our adoption process. We sent in our application to begin the home study, as well as our application to work with Faithful Adoption Consultants.

The home study entails gathering lots of documents, filling out paperwork, interviews with a social worker, as well as a social worker visit to our home to make sure it is child-friendly.

We should hear from FAC in a couple of weeks whether or not they are able to approve us as clients. This depends both on who we are as well as available space in their program at this time. Please pray that we are approved! But if it doesn't work out, we will know that God has another path for us to take.

We have 72% of our funds raised! Each month we continue to put aside a portion of our income toward our adoption savings. We have felt so loved and encouraged by the many generous contributions given by friends and family. Thank you so much for your support, prayers, and encouragement!!

We also have our yard sale fundraiser coming up in mid-April. If you have items for us to sell at the yard sale, send us an email at us@justiceadoption.com so we can coordinate a pick-up or drop-off time. We also need yard signs for advertising and to borrow a few folding tables for displaying items.

Thank you for your faithful prayers and excitement for our family as we continue on this journey!
