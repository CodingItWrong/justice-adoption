title: Almost Active!
---

FAC approved our profile book! We placed the order for printed copies on Friday and as soon as FAC receives them (sometime in the next week or so) our account will go "active." This means our profile book will start being presented to expectant moms who are making an adoption plan for their baby.

Please pray with us that every woman who reads our book will hear and feel God's love and care for her in the midst of her struggle and heartache. Pray also for wisdom and peace as these women face such huge, life-altering decisions.

And finally, pray that God would continue to prepare our family to welcome this precious baby into our family and to love his birth mom well in the process - whoever baby and mom might be!
