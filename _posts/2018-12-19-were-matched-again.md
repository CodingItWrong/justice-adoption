title: We're Matched...Again!

Only God could write this incredible story unfolding before us:

This morning around 11 o'clock we received a phone call from our attorney Emily and an expectant woman "D" that she would like to move forward with our family for her adoption plan! She is due January 10 but expects baby to come even sooner than that. We are so grateful to still be here in Louisiana so that we have the opportunity to both meet "D" beforehand and be available for whenever baby boy decides to make his arrival!

Our hearts and minds are spinning again, but this time it is with great joy and amazement! For those who may be wondering, many of the private details of this situation give us confidence that "D" is committed to this adoption plan and unlikely to change her mind.

Please join us once more in asking God to  guide us in loving and supporting "D" well during these weeks leading up to baby boy's birth, and that she would feel God's love and presence with her. Baby is currently breech so we are praying that he turns around so she is able to have a smooth, natural delivery. If he doesn't turn, she will likely need a c section.

We love getting to share this journey with you all and thank you for the continued prayers and love!
