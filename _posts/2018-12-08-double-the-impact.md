title: Double the impact
---

> We wish every woman could be assured of a loving community to walk beside her when facing an unintended pregnancy — a community to support her through her pregnancy and a specific family to welcome her baby into their home if that is the path she chooses.

I keep thinking back to our motivations for beginning this adoption journey and as I read back over this “mission statement” I find joy discovering that in this “failed match,” God is able to multiply our impact.

On our website we claimed, “We can’t be that family for every woman, but God has made it possible for us to be that family for one.” God has already used our family to love and support one woman, and now we are in a position to love and support one more! It brings me joy to know that we were able to love this expectant family well and to help carry them through this pregnancy. They received financial assistance for living expenses, counseling, legal guidance, and were confident of having a family to place their child in. Having these resources gave them a real choice about the future of their child rather than feeling trapped between aborting and parenting.

We don’t know the details of their ultimate decision to parent and likely never will, but as we told our girls, God made a way for them to parent this child and this is a good thing. I sincerely believe it is best for babies to stay with their birth parents if possible. The fact that this family was considering an adoption plan tells me that they sacrificially love their child and are willing to ask hard questions and take difficult steps for his well-being. And I will be praying for his well-being and his family’s for the rest of my life.

God used a church message about the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37) to point my heart towards adoption, and something that strikes me about this parable is that we know very little about the wounded man. We don’t know if he was kind or cruel, wise or foolish, wealthy or poor, religious or nonreligious, weak or strong, etc. And we don’t know how he responded to the Samaritan’s kindness. We don’t know because it doesn’t matter. Jesus calls us to love and to have mercy on all people regardless of … well, regardless of anything!

I don’t know whether or not the birth parents’ choice to parent is the best choice for this baby. I’ll be honest that I’m hurt by their lack of communication at the time of his birth. And I’m not completely naive: I know that there are fraudulent cases where expectant families “plan an adoption” just to receive financial assistance (which is illegal but hard to control). But none of this leads me to regret the path we have taken so far. God has poured out extravagant, unconditional love on us through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus regardless of either good intentions or selfish pursuits, rule-keeping or reckless living. And He invites us to do the same, to love others as He has loved us, extravagantly and unconditionally.

Josh and I have agreed we are ready to start receiving adoption situations again. Please join us in praying once again that the expectant mothers who receive our profile book would feel God’s love and care for them in the midst of their burdens and that God would continue to fill our family with peace as we wait for Him to match us with another expectant family.

Much love to you all and gratitude for your continued prayers and encouragement!!
