title: Yard Sale Fundraiser Saturday April 14
---

Let us know if you have any items for us to sell at our yard sale coming up next Saturday, April 14! We can arrange a pick-up or drop-off time.

We could use a few more folding tables for displaying items. Also, if anyone has a clothes rack we could borrow or suggestions on how to display clothes at a yard sale, let us know! We will mostly have baby clothes and maternity clothes for sale.

We would love to see you and your friends at our yard sale. We'll be posting an official "ad" soon and would love for you to help us spread the word! ðŸ˜Š
