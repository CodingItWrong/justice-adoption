title: Preparing for Baby
---

Every time I sit down to write another update, I'm overwhelmed with everything I want to share. For now, I'll start with the basics. Baby Brother's official due date is December 10, and we have already made plans to spend most of December in Louisiana. We know that we will need to be in LA for 2 weeks minimum because his birthmom cannot legally sign over parental rights until 5 days after his birth, and then it will take 1-2 weeks for the ICPC paperwork to be processed, which allows us to bring him home across state lines. We are getting the girls prepared for the possibility of celebrating Christmas in Louisiana!

Preparing for baby boy to join our family looks quite different than when we prepared for the births of our first two. Instead of gathering baby items and educating ourselves on birthing methods, we are seeking out toys and books with multi-racial representation and educating ourselves on raising a black child in the United States. It is quite an eye-opening journey.

We are learning about white privilege, cultural appropriation, and systemic racism. Part of our white privilege has been the freedom to be unaware of these realities that affect people of color every day. It's a lot to process, but we knew this is what we were signing up for when we decided to adopt a black baby. Black lives do matter, and our understanding of what that phrase means continues to deepen.

We are also listening to adult adopteesâ€™ perspectives on adoption, which is not always the heart-warming perspective that adoptive parents tend to have. As new adoptive parents, it's easy to focus on the joys of welcoming a new child into your family and overlook the fact that adoption inherently begins as a story of loss. Adoption is complicated, and everyone's story is different. We want to learn from others who have walked this road before us - adoptive parents, adult adoptees, and birth parents - so that we can be the parents our adopted son deserves as he navigates the complexities of being an adopted black man in America.

Here is just a sampling of the types of things we are reading and processing:

We continue to ask for your prayers:

- Please pray that the expectant mom carrying this baby will experience God's presence and love for her in new and unexpected ways.
- Pray for our girls as we enter a season of tremendous change - which is always difficult for little ones - living away from home for awhile and welcoming a new member of our family.
- Pray for God to continue to prepare our hearts and minds for all that lies ahead on this journey and that we would keep our eyes on His grace and provision through all!
