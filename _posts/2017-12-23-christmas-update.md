title: Christmas Update
---

You may have been wondering when you'll hear an update on our adoption journey. So this is no surprise of course but life is busy with a toddler and a 3.5 year old! Unfortunately, we've had our share of sicknesses around here, too. I've had my days wondering, "What are we thinking wanting to add another child to this family? Can we handle it?" But most of the time I can't wait to watch our girls with their baby brother. They are both such amazing helpers and so nurturing. We know we will have a lot of support when the time comes. And on those days when everyone seems grumpy and at odds, we know we have a God who is big enough to carry us through.

So far we have had $4,083 added to our Adoption Fund through several different avenues. We are so grateful to everyone who has generously supported us through finances, prayer, and encouragement!

We hope you have a Merry Christmas this year and that you know the love of God shining brightly for you through the birth of His Son. He came to earth to make a way for all people to be brought back close to Him and to live rich, abundant lives as part of His family. We hope you know He loves you and He is for you!

“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” - Luke 2:14
