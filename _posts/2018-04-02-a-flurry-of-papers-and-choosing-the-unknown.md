title: A Flurry of Papers and Choosing the Unknown
---

We received approval to work with Faithful Adoption Consultants! Thank you for praying with us. We are almost done with our home study - our last meeting is scheduled at our house on April 11 where we will hand over the last of the paperwork. Emily is in charge of giving our social worker a tour of our home ðŸ˜Š

But the paperwork and document gathering continues as we start moving toward becoming "active" with FAC. They have an extensive list of items needed in addition to our "profile book" which will have photos and descriptions of our family to present to expectant mothers. Let us know if you have skills in photo-book design and have an interest in helping us create this important snapshot of our family!

As I was going over the various documents from FAC, I opened one entitled â€œNext Stepsâ€œ for after youâ€™ve been matched with a child. It described how to prepare for the potential two week stay in another state while waiting for approval to bring your baby home across state lines. And it all started to feel more real â€” envisioning bringing our newborn baby not home but to a hotel, wondering if the girls should come with us or stay with grandparents. Will we need to fly or will it be close enough to drive?

It's easy to feel fearful in the face of the unknown. All sorts of questions keep forming in my head: Will we be bringing a newborn on our annual summer vacation this year? Will we get any sleep when there are three children needing help through the night? Will he be a good sleeper? Will we be able to breastfeed like I hope? How will people respond when they see our transracial family out and about? Will I have the courage I need to confront racism? Will I have trouble properly caring for his hair and skin? What if an expectant mom chooses us but then decides to parent instead? On and on the questions go. And I'm tempted to worry. I'm tempted to fear. I'm tempted to question choosing all of this uncertainty.

And then I hear Jesus asking, "Why are you afraid?" (Mark 4:40). During our Easter service, our pastor pointed out that one of Jesus' main refrains was that we don't need to be afraid - even when there is something to be afraid of. Adoption comes with many unknowns, many risks, and plenty to be afraid of. But even so we don't have to be afraid. We can face these uncertainties with assurance, hope, and confidence because we trust in a God who promised to overcome death and was true to His word. And we choose this unknown path because we have been called to love as Jesus loved us, holding nothing back. We choose faith and love over fear â€” faith in a God big enough to handle anything life throws us and love that focuses on how we can give and serve someone else instead of worrying about what it might cost us.

> "How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
> And feel the pride and joy he gives;
> But greater still the calm assurance:
> This child can face uncertain days because He Lives
>
> Because He lives I can face tomorrow
> Because He lives all fear is gone
> Because I know He holds the future
> And life is worth the living just because He lives"

We hope you had a joyful Easter, and we pray you know the assurance that comes from trusting in a risen Savior!
