title: End-of-Year Giving
---

If you're considering doing some end-of-year giving, you have the option of donating to our adoption in a tax-deductible way. We are partnered with AdoptTogether.com, an organization that will allow you to make tax-deductible donations for our adoption expenses.

Our pastor Andy likes to point out that we sometimes regret spending money, but we rarely regret giving money to a good cause.

We wish you a happy new year! We're hopeful that we might get to meet our son in 2018 â€” we hope you have a great 2018 as well.
