title: We Are Home!
---

On Wednesday we received approval to bring James across state lines so yesterday we made the 560 mile journey back to our home that we left 8 weeks ago! What an incredible, unforgettable journey this has been — and it's only just beginning.

As we packed up our things to finally drive back to Georgia, I remembered the days when I thought we would be driving home without a baby. I was heartbroken but not without hope. We were confident God had something even better in mind for our family, but we had no way of knowing if that path would be revealed within days, weeks, months, or years. We kept our hearts and hands open to whatever God had in mind. He doesn't always resolve these stories so quickly, but I absolutely love the story that I will get to tell my son about how God provided so much time for our family to build relationships with his first family and to absorb the culture of his hometown.

Josh and I joke that we were in Louisiana so long that it feels like we actually lived there. We found a church home and attended Bible Study Fellowship. We had memberships at the Zoo and children's museum. We invited the neighbors over for a birthday party. We ate king cake, attended a cochon de lait, and learned how to pronounce lagniappe (note from Josh: “I, for one, learned what it is but not how to pronounce it”). As we come home to Georgia, we leave a part of our hearts in Louisiana with both friends and family. What a beautiful, unexpected gift — God is so good!
