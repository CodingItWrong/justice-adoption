title: Monogrammed Decals and Tumblers Fundraiser
---

Our friend Julie Caesar runs a monogramming business. She has offered to donate part of the proceeds for several items to our adoption for the month of February.

- Monogrammed stainless steel tumblers for $20. $5 goes toward our adoption.
- Monogrammed decals, 3x3" for $5. $3 goes toward our adoption.

You can see a photo of the tumbler to the right. In addition to a scrolly font, she also offers a more "manly" font, shown below the tumbler.
