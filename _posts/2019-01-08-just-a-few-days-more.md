title: Just a Few Days More!
---

'll keep this short and sweet:

"D" is scheduled for an induction at 12:30am early Friday morning. She has invited me to be in the delivery room with her, so you can pray for me to be a good labor coach!

We hope that the next time you hear from us we will have a baby in our arms! 😍🙏

Prayer requests remain the same as before:

- Please pray with us that our relationship with "D" and her family continues to deepen in love and trust for one another.
- Pray for a smooth delivery, healthy baby, and quick recovery for "D."
- Pray for "D"s heart as she prepares to place her child with us — for comfort in her loss and peace about her decision. Pray that she feels God's arms holding her tight through this whole process.
- Pray for our adoption attorney as she works toward completing all of the many steps necessary before we can head home to GA. She is recovering from a stomach bug, so please pray for her health, too!
- Pray for all of our hearts to be prepared for life as a family of 5 (and all that comes with newborn life and adding a sibling to the mix 😉)!

We are so thankful to have you all going on this remarkable journey with us. 😊💕
