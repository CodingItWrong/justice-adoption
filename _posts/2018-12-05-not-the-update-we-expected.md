title: Not the Update We Expected
---

Wow, yesterday was quite a day. This is certainly not the update we thought we would be giving y'all. We started the day praying that the expectant family would show up for an important court hearing scheduled that morning. The family did not show and around 4:00pm we received a text from the expectant mom that she had gone into labor last Thursday and that she and the birth father have decided to parent their son. Our hearts and minds are spinning right now.

There is so much we could say, but for now we simply ask that you keep praying. We are looking to see what God will do next.

Please continue to pray that we would keep our eyes on the Lord and not be distracted by fears, anxiety, or anger. God has been so good to prepare both my heart and Josh's such that we both feel peace with the situation and continued love and grace towards the birth family.

Please continue to pray that the birth family would feel loved and supported by us and experience God's love and care for them in surprising ways. We don't know anything about their religious beliefs, but we pray that God would use these circumstances to bring them closer to Jesus and the abundant life found in Him.

And please pray for clarity regarding next steps. Specifically, we have decided to stay in Louisiana for December for the remainder of our house rental, and we have told the birth mom that we will be here and available if anything changes. Please pray for clarity as we make decisions about how long to stay here and if/when to start presenting to expectant moms again.

Thank you so much for your prayers. We feel so loved and encouraged by your support on this journey. God's timing is perfect as the girls and I already had plans to attend BSF in the morning here - the same Bible study that we attend weekly at home. What a gift to have a familiar environment to attend in the wake of such an emotional day! God is so good!
