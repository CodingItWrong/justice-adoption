title: Getting to Know You
---

We met "D" Saturday evening for a Cajun seafood dinner. She encouraged us to try the char-grilled oysters which were delicious. Almost immediately she volunteered that after looking at four family profile books, she felt a strong  connection with our family that she didn't feel with the others. She feels confident that she made a good decision choosing to place her son with us and that we will "raise her son right." What encouraging words to hear! She is a lovely, friendly, thoughtful, and warmhearted young lady, and we are so enjoying getting to know her.

Yesterday, Josh and I met her and her dad at a nearby mall to look around and get dinner together. I can see how "D" takes after her dad. He is friendly, respectful, and thoughtful, but also much more of a talker than his daughter. He said he thanks God for our family, and I told him that's exactly who he should thank since God is the one who brought us here!

"D" invited us to her prenatal appointment today. We ended up missing it because she was called back early (when does that ever happen!?). But the report is that baby is now in a good position for delivery so they won't need to schedule a c-section. We are thanking God for that answer to prayer as it will mean a much smoother recovery for her!

It still seems a bit hard to believe this is actually happening. We could have a baby in our arms any day now!

- Please pray with us that our relationship with "D" and her family continues to deepen in love and trust for one another.
- Pray for a smooth delivery, healthy baby, and quick recovery for "D."
- Pray for "D"s heart as she prepares to place her child with us - for comfort in her loss and peace about her decision. Pray that she feels God's arms holding her tight through this whole process.

We hope you all enjoyed a very merry Christmas celebrating the baby who taught us to love one another with radical, unconditional, all-in love. We pray that you may grasp the depths of his abundant love for you this Christmas season!

> For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.

– ‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭3:14-21‬
