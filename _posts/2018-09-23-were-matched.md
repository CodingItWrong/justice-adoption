title: We're Matched!!!
---

This past Tuesday afternoon, I had just posted a prayer request about our adoption to my BSF ladies. Less than 30 minutes later my phone rang. Our FAC consultant, Sara, was calling to tell me that an expectant mom wanted to talk with us on the phone!

We were able to talk with her Thursday afternoon and then Friday morning Sara called again to tell us that we are officially matched! Praise God for revealing this next step in our journey!

There is so much more to tell you about this story and all we are thinking and feeling, but we wanted to go ahead and  get this update out as I know everyone is eager to hear!

"Baby brother" is due mid-December and will be born in Louisiana. Josh and I hope to make a trip out to meet his birth mom sometime soon. We are keeping her personal information and story close to our hearts as it is her story to share, not ours, but please do continue to pray for her heart as this is obviously a very difficult decision and experience for her. And pray for God to show us how we can best love and support her in the days ahead.

Thank you so much for your prayers!!
