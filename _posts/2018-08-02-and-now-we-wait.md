title: And Now We Wait…
---

On July 24th our profile officially became active. We talked with our wonderful FAC consultant last Friday morning about what to expect moving forward. The work of paperwork is finished and now the work of patiently waiting begins.

It does feel like work — a persistent struggle to keep my hands open, to trust, to choose peace over impatience. It has only been a week, but that has been a week with no situations matching our criteria, no presentations of our profile book. A presentation doesn't in any way guarantee a match with a baby, but no presentations definitely does guarantee no match.

I was looking over our calendar for August and was struck by how little we have going on. I started brainstorming a possible road trip with the girls. And then I thought, "Hey God, this would be a great month for a road trip to go get our baby!" But I've read enough, heard enough, experienced enough to know that what looks like a good idea to me isn't always the best idea in reality. What an incredible gift to have Someone who loves us and knows every circumstance to choose the best time to bring this baby into our lives. Perhaps it won't be "best" in terms of our personal convenience but rather best for growing our faith and best for meeting the prayers of an expectant mother. After all, that is why we started out on this journey in the first place.

Thank you so much for your continued encouragement, excitement, and prayers for us as we enter this new chapter in our journey toward adoption.
