title: Sweet Baby James

<img src="/images/updates/sweet-baby-james.jpg" width="300px" style="float: right" /> I apologize for the radio silence these past months! Life is quite different for us back in Georgia: Our own house and mess to keep up with, no live-in Grandma keeping the girls busy, Josh is back to work of course, and we are slowly but steadily adjusting to life with three children! James has certainly done his best to make the transition smooth. He is the sweetest, most laid-back little man. We had this paperwork from the doctor up on our fridge for awhile that explained that it's normal for babies to cry for several hours a day. James is far from normal in the best way! We are wondering if he will keep up his quiet ways as he gets older or will join in heartily with his chatterbox sisters.

We are making our way through post-placement visits so that the adoption can be officially finalized in January or February of next year. Every state's laws are different and Louisiana just takes a bit longer than some. Our attorney explained that this is to make sure we are doing our job as parents and isn't anything to be anxious about.

We would love for you to continue praying for our relationship with James' first family. Obviously this is a painful, hard season for them missing this precious boy. Navigating communication with them has been confusing not knowing if what we say will bring grief or provide comfort. We want to love them well and it's not always clear what that looks like. Please pray for guidance, sensitivity, and authenticity.

And finally, thank you to all who passed along our request for milk donations. James has been exclusively drinking donated breastmilk, and he is thriving. What an incredible gift all these woman have given us and him in sharing their liquid gold with us! Our supply is running low so if you know of anyone who may be interested in donating, please let us know!

Much love to you all. Please let us know if you have any questions about how things are going or the adoption process. We would love to answer your questions!
