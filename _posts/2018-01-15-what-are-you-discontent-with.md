title: What are you discontent with?
---

We recently heard a sermon that reminded us of the focus we are trying to have in adoption. In it, our pastor Andy Stanley talks about the discontentment we can often feel with our possessions. Usually, we hear an encouragement to be more content, but Andy's focus was a bit different. He encouraged us to redirect our discontentment toward the needs of others.

It can be hard to say no to purchases just for the sake of saying no, but when you replace some of your desire for belongings with a desire to help others, that can make a big difference. This is an approach we are trying more and more to take, as hard as it is. When we focus on discontentment with the struggles others are having, we can find that we have a lot of resources available to giveâ€”and, what's more, we actually want to give it!
