title: Spring Yard Sale For Adoption
---

Our next fundraising effort is going to be a spring yard saleâ€”and we could use your help!

As you start thinking about spring cleaning, keep us in mind as a landing place for those random items around your house that still have life but just aren't contributing to yours.

Some specific types of items that should sell well are:

- Yard equipment
- Power tools
- Appliances in working order
- Office equipment
- Baby items and children's toys and books in good condition
- Health and beauty items (unused)
- Furniture
- Sports equipment

You can contact us at [us@justiceadoption.com](mailto:us@justiceadoption.com) if you have any donations you'd like us to pick up. Once we get a date schedule we'll set up some drop-off locations too.

We are brainstorming ways to make it a fun family event by incorporating activities like a bounce house or yard games. Please let us know if you have access to fun outdoor equipment or know of a company that might be willing to waive/discount rental fees.

Thank you so much for your support!
