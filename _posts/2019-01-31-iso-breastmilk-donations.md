title: ISO Breastmilk Donations
---

If you have or know of anyone with breastmilk to donate to baby James, please let us know! Katherine is still nursing, and I had hopes of nursing James, as well, but my body isn't responding very well to efforts to build my supply. When a new friend in Louisiana heard we were feeding James breastmilk, she contacted us to offer her frozen stash and connected us with some other women with breastmilk to share, as well. It was quite an unexpected gift! And it made me realize there are probably other women out there with freezer stashes that may be reaching expiration and needing to be put to use. If that's you or someone you know, we would love to hear from you!
